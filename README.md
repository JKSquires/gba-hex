# gba-hex

They say you shouldn't upload binaries to repositories, but in this case, I can't help it: I wrote it in hex!

**Note: unless a proper header is added, these programs will not work on real hardware (nor some emulators).**
I do not include the header in order to avoid copyright infringement, as it includes a bitmap of the Nintendo logo.
If you want to run these programs on an emulator, I'd recommend [No$gba](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm).
